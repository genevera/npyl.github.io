<span style="color:blue">*What if I told you I still like to tinker with Leo?*</span>

I'm currently installing MacOS X Leopard 10.5.2 on an old 2003 Dell Latitude D505.  Can you believe it? This lappy still works... I only had to replace a CMOS battery to get it back to life.  This is going to be a tinkertosh (the hackintosh/macintosh used for tinkering with cool stuff).

It's outdated as hell (although its windows vista era, in the apple word this means it has become obsolete 4-5 times now. :D ).

### Technical Details
This is a Kalyway 10.5.2 iso.  If you used to tinker with hackintoshing in the old days, you should have realised its Kalyway  from the OS version I chose to install (= 10.5.2). ðŸ˜‚
